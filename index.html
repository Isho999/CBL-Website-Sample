        <h1>What is J.L.?</h1>
        <p>J.L. Ilsley is a public high school located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is available for students in
            grades 9-12. As of 2021, a new school was built, with the old school being prepared for demolition and to be
            replaced with a football field. Before the new school was built, the previous school had been home to
            students for more than 50 years. The motto for J.L. Ilsley is "Justitia et Doctrina per Tempus" - ‘Justice
            and Wisdom Through Time’</p>

        <h1>Who was James Lorimer Ilsley?</h1>
        <p>James Lorimer Ilsley (January 3rd, 1894-January 14th, 1967) was a Canadian politician and jurist. Born in
            Somerset, Nova Scotia, Ilsley attended Acadia University and Dalhousie University. He was admitted to the
            bar in 1916 to practice law. Ilsley continued to study law in Yarmouth and Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was
            elected to the House of Commons, representing the Liberal party, in the 1926 election. Ilsley retained his
            position during the 1930 election, when the Liberals were in opposition.
            </br></br>
            Ilsley’s experience within the government influenced Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bring
            Ilsley into Cabinet as Minister of National Revenue. By 1940, Ilsley had gained so much reputation that he
            was promoted to Minister of Finance. He maintained this role for the duration of World War 2, and was
            responsible for managing funds to account for the damage caused by the war. </p>
